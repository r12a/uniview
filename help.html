<section>
  <p> UniView is a Web-based application for working with Unicode characters. No need to install anything – just open in a browser. You can look up  or find characters (using graphics or fonts) and related information, view whole character blocks or custom ranges, select characters to paste into your document, paste in and discover unknown characters, search for characters using regular expressions, do hex/dec/ncr conversions, highlight character types, etc. etc. <strong>It supports Unicode 15.0</strong> and is
    written with Web Standards to work on a variety of browsers.</p>
  <p>You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/r12a/uniview">on github</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/r12a/uniview/commits/gh-pages">list of recent changes</a>. See also the <a href="versiondata">change log</a> for a summary of changes in each release. If you spot a bug, <a href="https://github.com/r12a/uniview/issues">please raise a github issue</a>.</p>

<section id="overview">
  <h2><a href="#overview">Quick start</a></h2>
<p>To get started, either:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>select a Unicode block or character range using the controls at the top of the <span class="onscreen">Look up</span> tab, </li>
	<li>add characters, code points or text to  the <span class="onscreen">Search</span> field  on that tab and select  one of <span class="onscreen">Hex</span>, <span class="onscreen">Dec</span>, <span class="onscreen">Characters</span> or <span class="onscreen">Text</span>, or</li>
	<li>paste some text into the <span class="onscreen">text area</span> and hit  the  <img src="images/clickfromcparea.png" alt=" " style="height: 1.5em; width: 1.5em;"> button to list the characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>UniView produces <strong>tables</strong> or <strong>lists</strong> of characters in the <span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span> (lower left).</p>
	<p><strong>Clicking/tapping</strong> on characters in a table or list displays detailed information for them in the right-hand part of the page. <strong>Double-clicking/tapping</strong> adds the character to the <span class="onscreen">text area</span>. To move all characters to the <span class="onscreen">text area</span>, click on <img src="images/clicktocparea.png" alt=" " style="height: 1.5em; width: 1.5em;">.</p>
</section>


<section id="controlsexplained">
<h2><a href="#controlsexplained">Lookup controls</a></h2>


<section id="find_block">
    <h3><a href="#find_block">Look up &gt; find a block name</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/block_finder.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>The  control with the placeholder text &quot;Find a block name&quot; helps you find a block when you don't know how the name starts, or find a list of blocks with names that share the same text.</p>
<p>Just below that control is a pulldown control that lists all Unicode blocks, grouped by type or region. </p>
<p>Click on the <img src="images/help/down_arrow.png" alt=""> icon to refresh the results.</p>
<p>For example, to find a Pahlavi block, start typing 'pah'. You'll see the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/help/block_finder_example.png" alt=""></p>
 <p>Click on either of the block names. The name will appear in the field where you typed 'pah'. Chrome and Safari will immediately show the Unicode block you chose, but for Firefox you will need to hit return to show the block.</p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can display the result as either a table or a list (that includes names) by clicking the check box lower down entitled <span class="onscreen">Show range as list</span>.</li>
      <li>Unassigned character positions are shown in the table with a greyed out background.</li>
      <li>You can also specify a Unicode range by typing or pasting a hex code point range into the <span class="onscreen">Show range</span> box below this control.</li>
    </ul>
</section>




<section id="show_range">
    <h3><a href="#show_range">Look up &gt; Show range</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/show_range.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>If you type or paste a start and end code point value (in hex) into this control, the characters in the range will display below. Note that this can only be one contiguous range.</p>
    <p>Click on the <img src="images/help/down_arrow.png" alt=""> icon to refresh the results.</p>
    <p>If the range you select does not fill a whole column when displayed as a table, surrounding characters are greyed out. (When displaying as a list, you will only see the characters in the range.)</p>
    <p>The  range field will accept various formats, making it easier to paste a range from elsewhere. The numbers must be in hexadecimal form but can be separated by either a colon (the default), a hyphen, one or more spaces, or one or more periods. The code point values themselves can be in the following formats: 1234, &amp;#x1234;, \1234;, \u1234, U+1234. The actual number of hex digits can be between 1 and 6.</p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can display the result as either a table or a list (that includes names) by clicking the check box lower down entitled <span class="onscreen">Show range as list</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
          <section id="find_control">
    <h3><a href="#find_control">Look up &gt; search</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/find_control.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This control accepts a list of codepoint values in hexadecimal or decimal, a list of characters or a search string. After adding content to the input box, click on the appropriate button above the control to activate lookup. (If the correct button was already highlighted, you could just hit Enter or click on <img border="0" src="images/apply.gif" align="bottom" alt="the down-arrow icon" />. )</p>
    <p>Click on <img src="images/clearpicker.png" alt="the X icon" /> to quickly clear the control.</p>
    <h4>Looking for hex or dec codepoints</h4>
    
    <p>By default the control expects hex codepoint values. To look up a decimal value, click on the <span class="onscreen">Dec</span> button.</p>
    <p>This field is very forgiving about the format of the text entered into the box. Most types of  character escapes will be recognised, and you can even paste in surrounding text. For example, UniView will detect and list the characters referred to by code point in the text &quot;<em>the decomposition mapping is &lt;U+CE20, U+11B8&gt;, and not &lt;U+110E, U+1173, U+11B8&gt;.</em>&quot; Of course, this is not foolproof, but should provide the desired results most of the time.</p>
    <h4>Looking for characters</h4>
    <p>If the <span class="onscreen">Characters</span> button is selected, each character in the control will be processed. (Much of the time you will probably find it easier to use the <span class="onscreen">text area</span>  for this, but this control can be used if you want to look up some characters without disturbing a set of characters you are building up or using in the <span class="onscreen">text area</span>.)</p>
    <h4>Searching for text</h4>
    <p>By selecting the <span class="onscreen">Text</span> button you can search for text in the Unicode database, and returns a list of matching characters.</p>
    <p>You can  use  regular expressions in searches. For example, suppose you wanted to
              find all characters with the word 'tet'. You could type into the input field, <code>\btet\b</code>. The \b represents a word boundary. If you wanted to search for entries containing either the word 'tet' or the word 'tat' you can use the 'or' operator <code>|</code> as in <code>\btet\b|\btat\b</code>. (In UniView a colon can be used as a short form of <code>\b</code> so the example could have been written <code>:tet:</code>).</p>
    <p>Another example: You want to search for 'alpha', but you only want results for the Latin characters (not the many Greek or
              mathematical results). Simply use the following search string <code>latin.*alpha</code>. The <code>.*</code> represents any number of intervening
              characters.</p>
    <p>Basic regular expressions that work in  JavaScript  code should work. </p>
    <p><img src="images/help/find_control2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By default searches match against  character names and alternative names in the main Unicode database, and also searches the information displayed for an individual character under the heading Description in the right panel. You can limit the search using the <span class="onscreen">Names</span>, <span class="onscreen">Descriptions</span> and <span class="onscreen">Other</span> check boxes that appear below the  input box. <span class="onscreen">Other</span> refers to alternative names. If you want to set these before searching, just click on the <span class="onscreen">Text</span> button with nothing in the input box. It will bring up the checkboxes, which you can set as required. Then just enter your search string and click again on the <span class="onscreen">Text</span> button.</p>
    <p>You can also limit the search to the  characters  currently in a list or table.  To limit the search, select the check box labelled <span class="onscreen">Local</span>.  Matching characters will be highlighted. (You can then produce a list of just the highlighted characters by clicking on the icon next to <span class="onscreen">Filter </span><span class="onscreen">&gt; Make list from highlights</span>. If you need to refine your search, you could then search again on this list, and so on.)</p>
    <p>To clear the highlighting after doing a local search, just clear the <span class="onscreen">Find</span> input box, and hit the <span class="onscreen">Search</span> button again.</p>

  <section id="use_graphics">
    <h3><a href="#use_graphics">Look up &gt; Use graphics</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/use_graphics.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>If the check box is selected,  characters (apart from those in the <span class="onscreen">text area</span>  and notes area) will be shown as images, rather than text. </p>
    <p>Dedicated images are available for all characters except for those in the large Han, Hangul and Tangut blocks. Many of those characters are 
              however also available thanks to an agreement with the folks who run the <a href="http://decodeunicode.org/">decodeunicode</a> server.</p>
    <p>If you  want to find fonts, check out the <a href="/scripts/links">script resource pages</a>. When you select a Unicode block, a pointer to the relevant page appears at the top right of the panel. </p>
  </section>
  
  
  <section id="show_list">
    <h3><a href="#show_list">Look up &gt; Show tables as a list</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/show_list.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>If the check box is selected when you want to display a Unicode block or range, the characters will be displayed as a list, rather than a table.</p>
    <p>You can also use this to switch between table and list views of a range you have just selected.</p>
  </section>
  
  
  <section id="show_notes">
    <h3><a href="#show_notes">Look up &gt; Show notes</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/show_notes.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>If you display information about a character in the <span class="onscreen">Character details panel</span> (lower right) and  there are notes available for that character they will be displayed at the bottom of the page if this control is selected.</p>
<p>Not all characters have associated notes. When <span class="onscreen">Show block </span>is turned on, characters in the matrix for which there are notes are highlighted with an orange bar below. See the example here:</p>
<p><img src="images/help/note_highlights.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>The notes are not authoritative. They are compiled by myself as I learn about various scripts and characters. They are made available in case they are of use, but you should not assume that they are always correct, and they are certainly not complete.</p>
  </section>
  
  
  <section id="block_info">
    <h3><a href="#block_info">Block info link</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/block_info.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>The block info link appears when you select a block for display. Click on it to open a page of useful links related to that block. (The page opens in another window.)</p>
  </section>
</section>
  
<section id="text_area">
<h2><a href="#text_area">Text area</a></h2>
          <p>The <span class="onscreen">Text area</span>  is associated with a set of controls for managing characters as text. It makes UniView like a character map or picker tool, but also much more. You can add characters to the text area from other parts of UniView, or you can simply paste text into it for analysis.</p>
          <p>The insertion point for characters echoed to  the text area  can be changed in most browsers by just clicking where you want characters to appear. If you highlight a range of text, any typed or echoed characters will replace the highlighted range.</p>
    <p id="text_area_controls"><strong class="leadin">Text area controls.</strong> You can interact with the text in the text area using the icons below it. They are described here:</p>
          <ul>
<li>
  <p><img src="images/clickfromcparea.png" alt="with the two arrows" style="height: 2em; width: 2em;" /> Creates  a list in the <span ><span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span></span> of the characters in the <span class="onscreen">Text area</span>. This is particularly useful for investigating text with characters you can't see or correctly identify. Simply paste the text into the text area and click on this icon, and UniView will produce a list of the names and code points for all the characters in the text area. </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p><img src="images/clicktocparea.png" alt="with the two arrows" style="height: 2em; width: 2em;" />  Copies to the <span class="onscreen">Text area</span> all the characters currently displayed in a list or table in the <span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span>. This is particularly useful for capturing search results, or making a list of all characters in a block, etc.</p>
  <p>If you have filtered out characters in the <span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span>, only the unfiltered characters will be added to the text area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img border="0" src="images/selectall.png" align="bottom" alt="with two facing square brackets" /> Highlights all the text in the box. (Particularly useful to check you have caught all combining characters when copy-pasting to another location.)</p>
</li>
            <li>
<p><img border="0" src="images/addspace.png" align="bottom" alt="with a low line" /> Adds spaces between each of the characters in the text area. This is useful for generating space-separated lists of characters, or sometimes just for making it easier to see what characters are in the text area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img border="0" src="images/removespace.png" align="bottom" alt="with a low line" /> Removes whitespace from between each of the characters in the text area. (This can be useful for counting characters, see below).</p>
</li>
            <li>
              <p><img border="0" src="images/addcomma.png" align="bottom" alt="with a low line" />  Adds commas between each of the characters in the text area. This is useful for generating comma-separated lists of characters to be copy-pasted elsewhere.</p>
<p>Note: If you are using UniView on an iPad in portrait mode, this control is not available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/expand.png" alt="the hyphen icon" /> Any hyphen-separated lists in the text area are expanded. For example, if you have <samp>A-Z</samp> in the text box, it will be replaced with <samp>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</samp>.  You can expand multiple ranges at the same time. For example, <samp>A-Za-z0-9</samp> will expand to include all intervening characters for the three ranges specified.            </p>
<p><img src="images/rotate.png" alt="the hyphen icon" /> Allows you to convert a list of items on a single line to a vertical list. Add spaces where you want line-breaks to appear, then click on this icon.</p>
<p>Note: If you are using UniView on an iPad in portrait mode, this control is not available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/count.png" alt="the hash icon" /> Counts the number of codepoints in the text area.</p>
            </li>
<li>
<p><img src="images/convertPicker2Char.png" alt="convert Picker to Char" /> Converts all the characters in the text area to space-separated hexadecimal values. <img src="images/convertPicker2Hex.png" alt="convert Picker to Hex" /> Does the inverse: it converts a set of space-separated hex codes to characters. In fact, it can also accept a range of escapes as input, and they don't need to be space-separated.</p>
</li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/han.png" alt="the icon that looks like a Japanese character" /> Look up the Han characters in the text area in the UniHan database.  (Opens a page in a separate window.)</p>
    <p>If you have more than one code point or character in the box, UniView will open a separate window containing Unihan information for each. If you try to open more than 5 windows, a warning will pop up.</p>
    <p>You can also find a link to the Unihan database in the <span class="onscreen">character details panel</span>  when a CJK Unified Ideograph is displayed there.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
<p><img src="images/convert.png" alt="the icon with overlapping boxes" /> Converts any character escapes in the text area to ordinary characters.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful if you drag and drop a hex code point value from the <span class="onscreen">Character details panel</span> (such as that of a decomposition, or uppercase value). Clicking on this icon will convert the numbers to the character they represent.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p><img src="images/openConvert.png" alt="the icon with overlapping boxes" /> Opens a page in a separate window that converts characters in the text area to various escape or other forms.</p>
  <p>(You can also look up a single character at a time from the <span class="onscreen">Character details panel</span> by clicking on the <span class="onscreen">Conversion tool</span> link.)</p>
</li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/case_simple.png" alt="Analyse" /> Displays the characters in the text area  as a list in the lower right part of the page with all relevant characters converted to uppercase, lowercase and titlecase. Characters that had no case conversion information are also listed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/case_detail.png" alt="Analyse" /> Produces the same kind of output as clicking on the icon just above, but shows the mappings for those characters that have been changed, eg. <samp>e→E</samp>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img border="0" src="images/nfc.png" align="bottom" alt="ç" /> or <img border="0" src="images/nfd.png" align="bottom" alt="the NFD icon" /> Converts the text in the text area to Unicode Normalization Form C or D (NFC or NFD). The change may not be obvious, but if you click on <img border="0" src="images/apply.gif" align="bottom" alt="the down-arrow icon" /> you should see any changes to the text.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/clearpicker.png" alt="X" /> Clears all text from the text area.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
</section>
        


<section>
<h2 id="char_list_panel"><a href="#char_list_panel">Character list panel</a></h2>

<img  style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 7.5%" src="images/help/list_panel.png" alt=""/>
<p>The character list panel is where you will see tables and lists of characters that you generate from elsewhere in UniView.</p>
<p>When characters are displayed in table format and you hover over a character in this area you will see the code point and name appear at the top of the panel.</p>
<p>Whether in table or list format, if you click on a character one of two things will happen. Either details for that character will appear to the right, or the character will be added to the text area. The former is the default, but the latter will happen if you click on the icon described just below.</p>
<p>Unassigned character positions in a table are shown with a greyed out background (though you can <a href="#tailor">change</a> the colour, if you want).</p>





  
  
<section id="destination_toggle">
    <h3><a href="#destination_toggle">Destination toggle</a></h3>
<p><img src="images/sendToText.png" alt="Send characters to the text area." /> <img src="images/sendToPanel.png" alt="Send characters to the character detail panel." /></p>
    <p>Click on the above icons to determine what happens when you click on a character in a table. </p>
<p>If the first is showing, the character will be added to the text area. (You can also add characters to the text area, regardless of the settings of these icons,  by double-clicking on them.)</p>
    <p>If the second is showing, character data will be displayed in the character detail panel, to the right.</p>
</section>

</section>



<section style="clear:both;">
<h2 id="tags"><a href="#notes_panel">Tags</a></h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/help/tags.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>For each block or range of characters, these links allow you to quickly highlight characters with the property <code class="kw" translate="no">letter</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">mark</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">number</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">punctuation</code>, or <code class="kw" translate="no">symbol</code>. For more fine-grained property distinctions, see the <span class="onscreen">Filter</span> panel.</p>
<p>In addition, there are links for each of the subdivisions in the Unicode charts. Note that the subdivisions are listed in the order they appear in the charts, so in some cases there are more than one link with the same name. This is the case in Bengali, as you can see above, for the subdivisions called 'Various signs'.</p>

<img style="float: right; margin: 0 32% 2em 2em" src="images/help/details_panel.png" alt=""/>
<p>This panel shows detailed information and links for a single character.</p>
<p>The previous and next clickable text at the top allows you to step through characters in the block one by one. It skips code values that don't have assignments, and at the end of a block it will move you to the first character of the following block, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Han and hangul characters you will see a link <span class="onscreen">View in PDF code charts (pageXX)</span>. For Han blocks, this will open the PDF file for the block. The PDF is useful if there is no picture or font glyph for that character, but also allows you to see the variant forms of the character. Get <a href="#canviewhan">more information</a>.</p>

<p>The notes provide information I have gathered while learning about scripts, and should not be considered authoritative. Notes may change and new notes will be added from time to time.</p>
<p>If a note is displayed, you'll also find a link at the bottom of the <span class="onscreen">Character details panel</span> that allows you to open the full page from which the notes were taken. These pages carry annotations for a whole Unicode block or set of blocks.</p>

    <ul>
              <li><strong>uniview/?char=&lt;hex-codepoint&gt;</strong> Displays the information about the specified character in the right panel on
        startup.<br/>
        Eg. <a
						href="/uniview/?char=0449">http://r12a.github.io/uniview/?char=0449</a></li>
              <li><strong>uniview/?charlist=&lt;list-of-characters&gt;</strong> Displays the a list of the specified characters in the left panel on
                startup. <br/>
                Eg. <a href="/uniview/?charlist=adg">http://r12a.github.io/uniview/?charlist=adg</a></li>
              <li><strong>uniview/?block=&lt;block_name&gt;</strong> Displays the specified block in the left panel on startup. The block name must
        be written exactly as it appears in the pulldown selector at the top left of the page, except that any spaces must be replaced by  underscores ('_'), and case is not important.<br/>
      Eg. <a href="/uniview/?block=ipa_extensions">http://r12a.github.io/uniview/?block=ipa_extensions</a></li>
              <li><strong>uniview/?codepoints=&lt;list-of-hex-codepoints&gt;</strong> A list of the characters will be displayed in the left panel. Any spaces must be replaced by
         underscores ('_'), and case is not important.<br/>
      Eg. <a href="/uniview/?codepoints=449_1234_65">http://r12a.github.io/uniview/?codepoints=449_1234_65</a></li>
            </ul>
    <p>You should only use one of these query parameters in a single call to UniView.</p>
          <!--<div class="topic"> 

				<h3 class="collapse">creating your own character description notes <span style="color:red;">[Updated]</span></h3>
				<p>These notes will appear immediately below the standard information in the right panel. To see how this works, type into the 'Notes'
					field the following:</p>
				<blockquote> 
					<p>notes/devanagari.xml</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> Then select the devanagari block from the top left. Next click on characters such as U+0902: DEVANAGARI SIGN ANUSVARA. You will see
					the additional notes under a horizontal bar in the right panel.</p>
				<p>You can link to any appropriate notes file on the internet - your own or someone elses - by entering the URI in the 'Notes' field.
					</p>
				<p>Follow these steps to create your own notes.</p>
				<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create your own XHTML file containing the notes you want, character by character. The notes for each
					individual character should be surrounded by a &lt;div&gt; element which has an id attribute set to C&lt;hexcode&gt; and a class name set to 'notes'.
					For example, notes for the U+0902: DEVANAGARI SIGN ANUSVARA would be placed inside the following markup: &lt;div id="C0902"
					class="notes"&gt;....&lt;/div&gt;. Everything inside this div will be displayed when you view that character in the right-hand panel.</p>
				<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a copy of your file with the extension '.xml' and upload the file to an accessible place. (You could
					just serve that file as XML, but making a copy allows you to access the original as HTML still.)</p>
				<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Type the URI of your file into the 'Notes' field.</p>
				<p>Now whenever you display a character for which notes exist in the right-hand panel, your notes will appear also. </p>
				<p>Apart from things like IPA characters (which are spread across several blocks), I tend to use separate files for separate scripts, but
					you can decide whether your file contains notes on characters from a single block or many blocks. It doesn't matter. </p>
