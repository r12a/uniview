Step 1
Download the following from the Unicode site to the UCD directory.
Blocks-xxx.txt
DerivedAge-xxx.txt
NamesList-xxx.txt
UnicodeData-xxx.txt
Make copies in the generatedata directory without the version info in the filename.

Step 2
Run: genScriptGroups.plx
	Input: Blocks.txt
	Output: scriptGroups.js
	
	Do a diff against /shared/scriptGroups.js and update that file with the new lines

	Add the new blocks to the selector and the #blockhints in index.html
	

Step 2a
Run: genDerivedAge.plx
	Input: DerivedAge.txt
	Output: age.txt
	// expands derived age data to one line per character with format DDDDD:a, etc.
	// this perl file maps release numbers to letters
	
	
Step 3
Run: genDescriptions.plx
	Input: NamesList.txt
	Output: descriptions.js + subtitles.js + tempSubtRefs.txt

Remove the first entry in the array created in descriptions.js. 
Search & replace all & to &amp;.


Step 4
Run: genUnicodeData.plx
	Input UnicodeData.txt + DerivedAge.txt + tempSubtRefs.txt
	Output: u.js

	// adds pointers to age.js and to subtitles.js
	// rearranges order of items to reduce bandwidth


Step 5
Run make_name_list.html
Copy the resulting file all-names.js to /shared/code/


Step 6
Copy the following files to the main directory:
	descriptions.js
	u.js
	names.php
	subtitles.js



----------------------


Step 5
Run: genNamesOnly.plx
	Input UnicodeData.txt
	Output: Names.php

Step 6
Run: genMenu.plx
	Input: Blocks-xxx.txt
	Output: menu.txt

Reorder the menu items as needed, and copy paste to index.html.
