Step 1
Download the following from the Unicode site to the UCD directory.
Blocks-xxx.txt
DerivedAge-xxx.txt
NamesList-xxx.txt
UnicodeData-xxx.txt
Make copies in the generatedata directory without the version info in the filename.

Step 2
Run: genScriptGroups.plx
	Input: Blocks.txt
	Output: scriptGroups.js
	
	Do a diff against /shared/scriptGroups.js and update that file with the new lines

	Add the new blocks to the selector and the #blockhints in index.html
	

Step 2a
Run: genDerivedAge.plx
	Input: DerivedAge.txt
	Output: age.php
	
Step 3
            // Convert NameList.txt to utf-8, using TextWrangler/Word
Run: genDescriptions.plx
	Input: NameList.txt
	Output: descriptions.js + subtitles.php + tempSubtRefs.php

Remove the first entry in the array created in descriptions.js. 
Search & replace all & to &amp;.

Step 4
Run: genUnicodeData.plx
	Input UnicodeData.txt
	Output: tempu.php

		{{ If this is a beta release do the following:
		Then for beta, copy old u.php to the directory and name it uold.php, and run doDiff.php
		-> u_withdiffinfo.php
		Then run doBetaGraphics.php  // need to add subtitles stuff !
		-> u.php
		}}


Step 4a  (if just updating the graphics list, update graphicranges.php and just do this step and copy u.js to the main directory)

Run:  doGraphics.php  // adds pointers to local graphics and to subtitles in subtitles.php
	Input tempu.php + tempSubtRefs.php + age.php + graphicranges.php
	Output: u.js


Step 5
Run: genNamesOnly.plx
	Input UnicodeData.txt
	Output: Names.php

Step 6
Run: genMenu.plx
	Input: Blocks-xxx.txt
	Output: menu.txt

Reorder the menu items as needed, and copy paste to index.html.

Step 7
Copy the following files to the main directory:
	descriptions.js
	u.js
	names.php
